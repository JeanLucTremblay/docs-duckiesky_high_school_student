<!-- gwnote: it would be nice to explain the concepts introduced in the teacher book such as oxidation, flux, temperature; ie soldering theory-->
To solder with flux, simply follow the steps of soldering from the previous lesson, except before tinning the wire, stick the soldering iron into the flux and apply it on the wires. This will make the solder flow easier, but is not always necessary. Here's a helpful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z8CzB4BYJA) that demonstrates this.
<!-- gwnote: In above paragraph: do we want students sticking the soldering iron into the flux or coating the metal components with flux? -->
Through-hole soldering is another form a soldering used on the Pi on the drone. This is simply when a wire is stuck through a previously made hole on a PCB. To complete through hole soldering, tin the wire, stick it through the pre-made hole, and solder the tip of the wire to the metal surrounding the hole. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAx89WhpZ3k) is a great demonsration on this technique.
<!-- gwnote: would like to see instructions/tutorials on the three types of soldering techniques used in the drone build: through-hole, wire-to-wire, wire-to-pad -->
