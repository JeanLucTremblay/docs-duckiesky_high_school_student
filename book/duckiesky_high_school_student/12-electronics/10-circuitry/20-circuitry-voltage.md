# Voltage, Current, Resistance {#electronics-circuitry-voltage status=ready}

<!-- gwnote: While there are many great links that explain voltage, current, and resistance, I think the links could use a proper introduction with a brief background. Consider giving an overview of the concepts, and linking to the resources when appropriate. This is also a great space to describe where these concepts are used on the drone. -->
