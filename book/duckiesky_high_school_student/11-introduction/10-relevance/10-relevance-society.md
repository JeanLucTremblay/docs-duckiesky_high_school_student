## Impact

### Why is it essential to learn about robotics? 

Robotics matter because they can take autonomous actions in the real physical world, which can affect almost every aspect of human existence. It is an interdisciplinary research area part of Engineering and Science. It involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.

### How do robotics help our communities in society?**

 The end goal is to create intelligent machines that outperform a human being's ability in a specific task or replace said human in a task too complex or far too dangerous. Making them near perfect multi use tools for industries and corporations of any kind. Today robots impact the defense industry, manufacturing,  the service industry, and more, with potential to positively transform work practices.
