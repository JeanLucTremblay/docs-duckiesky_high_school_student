# Networking {#computing-pi-networking status=ready}
<!-- gwnote: an overview of how networking is used on the drone, and a brief introduction to the purpose of the 7 Layers of Abstraction would be appropriate (make students want to click the edX link to learn more!) -->
## 7 Layers of Abstraction

-  If not for networking, we would not be able to connect to and run our drones, so it's important for us to learn the concepts of Networking!
    - [Learn about](https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BrownX+CS195R+2018_T1/courseware/0e3596880ec446d8ab63df427e02e9c4/56017f6d3048461b90466ad229ac8df6/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ABrownX%2BCS195R%2B2018_T1%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%4056017f6d3048461b90466ad229ac8df6) the 7 layers of abstraction at our edX lesson.
        - What is outlined here is the basis of what is used for our computers, mobile devices, and even with our drones.

<!--  
    - Use HTTP and inspect the element
        - Netcat wont work through the drone in the lesson that was made

## Basestations

- What is a basestation?
    - For our purposes, a basestation is a laptop or desktop (ie. not a tablet) with the ability to connect to WiFi over a network and that has the ability to run/read python.
-  How can we control our basestations?   
    - A shell is a programming language that takes input and gives the input to the computer and operating system to analyze and perform the task that the input asks for. 
    - A terminal is a program that allows the user to interact with the shell.
        - We will learn more about the terminal in the next lesson on Bash, which is the programming language that many terminals run in.
    - SSH (Secure Shell) is a method that allows a user to remotely log in from one computer/device to another. We utilized SSH to connect to our Pi in the past before we implemented the really handy text editor! 
        - If you would like, you could attempt to follow our [old build instructions](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/opmanual_sky/out/build_phase5.html) to connect to the drone over SSH, but this may be a very self guided process (additionally it may not be compatible over Chromebook).

## Networking with our Drone

- Connect to the Pi following the [Build Part 1 Checkpoint Instructions](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/opmanual_sky/out/build_part1_checkpoint.html) from the Operations Manual
    - The text editor on this screen is Visual Studio Code (VSCode). This is a source editor that allows you to edit various files (like text and Markdown files). Use the editor to open and look at the files in the directory.
    - On the bottom of the screen is a terminal that runs in Bash. We will be learning about and directly utilizing this terminal in the next Unit.
        - If you can't find the terminal, follow the first 10 seconds of [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HvtKNhsjG_dQt2edeJ40WdhmyO649ZOd/view?usp=sharing) to open the terminal.
